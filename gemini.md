Image generation with Gemini (aka Nano Banana)

content_copy



Gemini can generate and process images conversationally. You can prompt Gemini with text, images, or a combination of both allowing you to create, edit, and iterate on visuals with unprecedented control:

Text-to-Image: Generate high-quality images from simple or complex text descriptions.
Image + Text-to-Image (Editing): Provide an image and use text prompts to add, remove, or modify elements, change the style, or adjust the color grading.
Multi-Image to Image (Composition & Style Transfer): Use multiple input images to compose a new scene or transfer the style from one image to another.
Iterative Refinement: Engage in a conversation to progressively refine your image over multiple turns, making small adjustments until it's perfect.
High-Fidelity Text Rendering: Accurately generate images that contain legible and well-placed text, ideal for logos, diagrams, and posters.
All generated images include a SynthID watermark.

Image generation (text-to-image)
The following code demonstrates how to generate an image based on a descriptive prompt.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import * as fs from "node:fs";

async function main() {

  const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

  const prompt =
    "Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant with a Gemini theme";

  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image",
    contents: prompt,
  });
  for (const part of response.parts) {
    if (part.text) {
      console.log(part.text);
    } else if (part.inlineData) {
      const imageData = part.inlineData.data;
      const buffer = Buffer.from(imageData, "base64");
      fs.writeFileSync("gemini-native-image.png", buffer);
      console.log("Image saved as gemini-native-image.png");
    }
  }

Other image generation modes
Gemini supports other image interaction modes based on prompt structure and context, including:

Text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Outputs images with related text.
Example prompt: "Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."
Image(s) and text to image(s) and text (interleaved): Uses input images and text to create new related images and text.
Example prompt: (With an image of a furnished room) "What other color sofas would work in my space? can you update the image?"
Multi-turn image editing (chat): Keep generating and editing images conversationally.
Example prompts: [upload an image of a blue car.] , "Turn this car into a convertible.", "Now change the color to yellow."
Prompting guide and strategies
Mastering Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Generation starts with one fundamental principle:

Describe the scene, don't just list keywords. The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words.

Prompts for generating images
The following strategies will help you create effective prompts to generate exactly the images you're looking for.

1. Photorealistic scenes
For realistic images, use photography terms. Mention camera angles, lens types, lighting, and fine details to guide the model toward a photorealistic result.

Prompt

REST

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import * as fs from "node:fs";

async function main() {

  const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

  const prompt =
    "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop with pottery wheels and shelves of clay pots in the background. The scene is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window, highlighting the fine texture of the clay and the fabric of his apron. Captured with an 85mm portrait lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood is serene and masterful.";

  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image",
    contents: prompt,
  });
  for (const part of response.parts) {
    if (part.text) {
      console.log(part.text);
    } else if (part.inlineData) {
      const imageData = part.inlineData.data;
      const buffer = Buffer.from(imageData, "base64");
      fs.writeFileSync("photorealistic_example.png", buffer);
      console.log("Image saved as photorealistic_example.png");
    }
  }
}

Best Practices
To elevate your results from good to great, incorporate these professional strategies into your workflow.

Be Hyper-Specific: The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
Provide Context and Intent: Explain the purpose of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output. For example, "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" will yield better results than just "Create a logo."
Iterate and Refine: Don't expect a perfect image on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes. Follow up with prompts like, "That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?" or "Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious."
Use Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn. Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar. Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."
Use "Semantic Negative Prompts": Instead of saying "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
Control the Camera: Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like wide-angle shot, macro shot, low-angle perspective.
Limitations
For best performance, use the following languages: EN, es-MX, ja-JP, zh-CN, hi-IN.
Image generation does not support audio or video inputs.
The model won't always follow the exact number of image outputs that the user explicitly asks for.
The model works best with up to 3 images as an input.
When generating text for an image, Gemini works best if you first generate the text and then ask for an image with the text.
Uploading images of children is not currently supported in EEA, CH, and UK.
All generated images include a SynthID watermark.
Optional configurations
You can optionally configure the response modalities and aspect ratio of the model's output in the config field of generate_content calls.

Output types
The model defaults to returning text and image responses (i.e. response_modalities=['Text', 'Image']). You can configure the response to return only images without text using response_modalities=['Image'].

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image",
    contents: prompt,
    config: {
        responseModalities: ['Image']
    }
  });
Aspect ratios
The model defaults to matching the output image size to that of your input image, or otherwise generates 1:1 squares. You can control the aspect ratio of the output image using the aspect_ratio field under image_config in the response request, shown here:

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-image",
    contents: prompt,
    config: {
      imageConfig: {
        aspectRatio: "16:9",
      },
    }
  });
The different ratios available and the size of the image generated are listed in this table:

Aspect ratio	Resolution	Tokens
